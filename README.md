*Groblin* is a headless *content management system* that exposes a read-only graphql API for dynamically defined models. A somewhat definining feature is that the data is structured in a tree, very much like a JSON document.

Each node has different types and based on the type and settings different editors can be used to maintain the content.

The structure of the tree simultaneously creates a graphql interface for clients to consume.
